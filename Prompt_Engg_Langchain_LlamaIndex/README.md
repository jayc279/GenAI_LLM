# Langchain
[LangChain Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/), it states that LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. The langChain framework is available in both Python and JavaScript packages. The Notebooks in this repository focus on Python.

# OpenAI Embeddings  
An embedding is a vector (list) of floating point numbers. The distance between two vectors measures their relatedness. Small distances suggest high relatedness and large distances suggest low relatedness. Embeddings are commonly used for:
- **Search** (where results are ranked by relevance to a query string)
- **Clustering** (where text strings are grouped by similarity)
- **Recommendations** (where items with related text strings are recommended)
- **Anomaly detection** (where outliers with little relatedness are identified)
- **Diversity measurement** (where similarity distributions are analyzed)
- **Classification** (where text strings are classified by their most similar label)

# PyPDFLoader
**Yahoo Search** The PyPDFLoader is a custom loader class or module that is responsible for loading and splitting the PDF document. In summary, the code reads the uploaded PDF file, saves it to a temporary file, creates a PyPDFLoader object using the temporary fileâ€™s path, and then loads and splits the PDF document into pages.

# ChatGPT - gpt-3.5-turbo
**Yahoo Search** The most capable and cost effective model in the GPT-3.5 family is GPT-3.5 Turbo, which has been optimized for chat and works well for traditional completions tasks as well. GPT-3.5 Turbo is available for use with the **Chat Completions API**

# Prompt Engineering 
In general terms **Prompt Engineering** is the basically interaction between AI completion and Human intent. AI is trained on vast amounts of data, and the way questions are phrased make a difference between targetted output and hallucinations from AI.  

**Prompt Engineering** is not about getting the right response, but enabling AI to understand the intent and context of the query from human interaction. 

**Prompt Engineering** is deeply rooted in **NLP** which is rule-based and relies heavily on manually crafted alogrithms and intricacies of human language. **Prompt Templates** aid in crafting rules specific to a domain and depends on which GPT model is used *foundation* model or a *fine-tuned* model.
